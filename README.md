# Console-Finances

## Description

I was presented with a real-world situation to utilise my new-found JavaScript skills. I was tasked with creating code for analysing the financial records of a company. I was provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file. 

### Project Specification

The instructions for the task were as follows:

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  - The total number of months included in the dataset.

  - The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

      -You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
       (Total/Number of months)

  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Upon opening the browser the resulting anaylsis should look as follows:

## Skills

- Initially, pseudocode was used to visualise and explore the actions and instructions that would need to utilise in order to write code to analyse the       financial data accurately.        
- Knowledge and understanding of multidimensional arrays.
- Variables were used to organise data.
- For loops were used to analyse the data logically and efficiently. 
- JavaScript math functions.

## Deployment

The analysis can be accessed [here.](https://clairegreenwood83.github.io/Console-Finances/)

- Once opened, right click anywhere in the body of the browser and select 'inspect'.

- To the right of the screen a new window will open, find and click on console (as shown below).

- The results of the financial anaylsis will be shown as follows:
