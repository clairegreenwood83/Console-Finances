# Console-Finances

## Description

I was presented with a real-world situation to utilise my new-found JavaScript skills. I was tasked with creating code for analysing the financial records of a company. I was provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file.

The instructions for the task were as follows:

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.
Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/Number of months)

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.



Upon opening the browser the resulting anaylsis should look as follows:
