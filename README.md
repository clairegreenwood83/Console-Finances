# Console-Finances

## Description

I was presented with a real-world situation to utilise my new-found JavaScript skills. I was tasked with creating code for analysing the financial records of a company. I was provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file. The skills and knowledge used include pseudocoding, for loops, variables, mulitdimensional arrays and conditional logic. 

### Project Specification

The instructions for the task were as follows:

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  - The total number of months included in the dataset.

  - The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

      -You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
       (Total/Number of months)

  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Upon opening the browser the resulting anaylsis should look as follows:
